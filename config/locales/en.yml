# Sample localization file for English. Add more files in this directory for other locales.
# See http://github.com/svenfuchs/rails-i18n/tree/master/rails%2Flocale for starting points.
# The underscores (_) before a key indicates that the word is not used in the beginning of a sentence
# and thus is not capitalized in most languages, but might be capitalized in some (e.g. the name of a month, a noun in German, etc.)
# The _verb suffix represents an English word that is a verb, but at the same time a noun. This is usually not the case in other languages.
